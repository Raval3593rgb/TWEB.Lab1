<p style="text-indent: 20px;">The Switch was officially released on March 3, 2017, worldwide in Japan, most English-speaking and Western markets and in the United Arab Emirates. It was released with an MSRP of ¥29,980 in Japan, US$299.99 in the United States, £279.99 in the United Kingdom, and A$469.95 in Australia; with standardized pricing for the European market varying. The set includes a Switch console, a dock; left and right Joy-Con controllers and accompanying straps; a Joy-Con grip, an AC power adapter and an HDMI cable. There were two Switch bundles available at launch, one with grey Joy-Con and one with neon red and blue Joy-Con. Nintendo feared that a higher price would harm sales, which prompted them to not include any additional hardware or games. </p>
